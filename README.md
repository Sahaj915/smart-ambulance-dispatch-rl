# 🚑 Smart Ambulance Dispatch & Hospital Routing using Reinforcement Learning

A production-ready Reinforcement Learning environment that simulates real-world Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatch and hospital routing optimization.

This project trains an intelligent RL agent to make time-critical decisions such as:

* selecting the best available ambulance
* prioritizing emergency calls based on severity
* routing patients to the most suitable hospital
* handling traffic and hospital capacity constraints
* maximizing patient survival probability

The system is built using **Gymnasium**, **Stable-Baselines3 (PPO)**, and **Gradio** for interactive simulation.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Emergency medical dispatch is a high-stakes real-time decision problem.

In real-world scenarios, dispatch systems must manage:

* multiple simultaneous emergency calls
* limited ambulance fleet availability
* varying patient severity
* dynamic traffic conditions
* hospital bed / ICU constraints

A poor dispatch decision can significantly increase response time and reduce survival chances.

This project solves the problem using **Reinforcement Learning**, where the agent learns an optimal dispatch policy through reward-based learning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* minimize emergency response time
* maximize patient survival
* efficiently utilize ambulance resources
* reduce failed hospital admissions
* prioritize critical patients

---

## 🧠 How the Agent Works

At every step, the RL agent must:

1. choose an available ambulance
2. assign it to the highest-priority emergency call
3. select the most appropriate hospital
4. avoid routing to full hospitals
5. intelligently use the wait action when necessary

## 🌍 Environment Design

The environment simulates:

* ambulance locations
* hospital positions
* hospital capacities
* active emergency calls
* patient severity
* traffic variation
* waiting time

---

## 📊 Observation Space

The state space is represented as a normalized vector containing:

### 🚑 Ambulance Features

* x coordinate
* y coordinate
* status
* remaining busy time
* current patient severity

### 🏥 Hospital Features

* location
* bed capacity ratio
* ICU capacity ratio
* hospital specialty

### 📞 Emergency Calls

* location
* severity
* wait time
* survival probability

### 🌐 Global Features

* traffic factor
* pending calls
* critical patients waiting
* episode progress

---

## 🎮 Action Space

Discrete action space:

```text id="readme-action"
N_AMBULANCES × N_HOSPITALS + 1
```

Example:

```text id="readme-example"
5 ambulances × 3 hospitals + 1 wait = 16 actions
```

---

## 💰 Reward Function

```

### ❌ Penalties

```python id="readme-negative"
-5.0   full hospital selected
-6.0   unnecessary wait
-8.0   failed admission
-15.0  critical patient lost
```
